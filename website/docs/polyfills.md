One of our goals is to provide developers with access to newest ECMA-402 Intl APIs. Therefore, FormatJS suite also provide multiple high quality polyfills that are fully tested using the [Official ECMAScript Conformance Test Suite](https://github.com/tc39/test262).

Our current list of polyfills includes:

- [Intl.PluralRules](polyfills/intl-pluralrules.md)
- [Intl.RelativeTimeFormat](polyfills/intl-relativetimeformat.md)
- [Intl.DisplayNames](polyfills/intl-displaynames.md)
- [Intl.NumberFormat](polyfills/intl-numberformat.md) (ES2020)
